# Library-Management-System-Ruby-on-Rails
The Library Management System (LMS) is designed in favor of the Library Management which helps them to save the records of the members about their transactions. It helps them from the manual work from which it is very difficult to find the records of the books and the transactions of the members. LMS is the system software that manages the member data, staff data, membersâ€™ registration process and create receipts for the fine paid by the member. We design this system software as per the modern requirements of the library which automatically calculates the number of books present in stack, how many are issued etc. It is possible to check the personal profiles of all the current members. Through this system it is becomes easy to maintain a large library and its databases.
